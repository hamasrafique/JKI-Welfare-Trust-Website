JKI Welfare Trust - Fully Responsive Website
I developed a fully responsive website for my client, JKI Welfare Trust, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is designed to be user-friendly and accessible across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Key features include a clean layout, interactive elements, and seamless navigation, ensuring an excellent user experience.

This project highlights my expertise in front-end development, with a focus on responsive design and web performance. Feel free to explore the repository to see the code and functionality in action!
